## What is TechieInfo?

TehieInfo is a frontend facade for the [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) site, that uses Hacker News API.

## Why should i use TechieInfo?

The purpose of this project is to provide a modern and minimalistic interface, adapted for readability of the news that appears on Hacker News.

Its design is intended for you to easily and conveniently use your mouse to point and click on the news or comments that you want to read or go back to the main page. 

## How to use TechieInfo?

Use it just like the good old Hacker News site.

## Why does TechieInfo exist?

TechieInfo is a one-person project, that was created for the sole purpose of practicing and learning current web technologies. I'm a semi-regular Hacker News reader, and this proyect is a both a way to practice my programming skills and build the Hacker News site that i want.

## Why shouldn't I use TechieInfo?

Because it uses the public Hacker News API, which does not provide endpoints for every Hacker News features. Some of the features that are not available are:
- User registration
- User information editing
- Post voting
- Post submit
- Commenting on posts
- Comment voting

In general, anything that requires POST or PUT requests won't be available since the public Hacker News API only provides GET endpoints.
